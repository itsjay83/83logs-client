				<h2>Current Interests</h2>
				<p>
					My recent focus has shifted beyond simply using AI tools to a deeper
					question:{" "}
					<strong>
						How can I make AI work like a colleague who efficiently handles my
						tasks?
					</strong>{" "}
					I'm exploring ways to integrate AI not as a replacement, but as a
					collaborative partner that understands my workflow and amplifies my
					productivity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this era where countless AI technologies emerge daily, I'm
					constantly reflecting on{" "}
					<strong>what attitude I should maintain as a developer</strong>.
					Rather than being overwhelmed by the rapid changes, I choose to see
					each new technology as an opportunity to better serve people and solve
					problems more effectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					What keeps me going is a simple but powerful belief:
					<strong>"If you can imagine it, you can achieve it."</strong> This is
					why I never give up. Every challenge, every setback, and every
					seemingly impossible problem is just another step toward turning
					imagination into reality. This mindset drives me to continue pushing
					boundaries and creating solutions that seemed impossible yesterday.
